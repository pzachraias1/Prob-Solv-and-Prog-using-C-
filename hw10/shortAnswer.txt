Homework 10: Template

1. What is a template?
It is a generic class. It is a type of class or function that it is not specific on the data type that either takes in as argument or return a non specific data type value.

2. What is the fundamental difference between how Java and C++ implement collections?
C++ uses Template but Java uses a universal base class

3. What is the difference between a template and a class?
Class is a type of class that the data types are specific. Whereas Template, the datatype can be specific at a later time. Template class data type does not need to be specific at start.

Implementing a class does not need <> whereas Template is implemented as <>.

7. What is the difference between the meaning of <> in a Java generic and in a C++ template
instantiation?
The <> in Java does not mean a lot. Like the data type that is being put in the <> is always going to come out as String Object. In C++, it mean that you are creating a class with custom-written code to it.

8. Why canâ€™t you store references in a container?
    There is no way to initialize the reference in a collection
