Homework 1: Chapter 1 and 2
1, 3, 9, 10, 11

1.	Why would it be a bad idea to enter the following bash commands? 
	cd
	rm -r * 
    a.	Using the rm -r mean that you are going to delete stuff that is intended to be deleted and everything inside the file

2.	What is the difference between compiling and linking?
    a.	The compiling is creating or generating a file, but it is not executable. Linking is the conversion of the file into an executable file, meaning that the file can be run.

3.	Would the following code compile in C++? Why or why not?
	double x = 32.0;
	int n = x;
    a.	It is going to compile since the variable n is equal to variable x. eventhough it is a different data type, the integer n will convert double x (32.0) into an integer (32).

4.	What is wrong with the following code, and how would you fix it?
	int sum;
	for(int i=0; i<1000; ++i) {
		sum += i; }
    a.	The variable sum is not properly initialize and it is going to fail when run. Since the variable sum is not initialize, the for loop would fail since variable sum is empty or not assign is equal to and plus variable i.

5.	What is wrong with the following code, and how would you fix it?
	int n = 1;
	if(n = 0) {
	printf("n is zero\n");
	}
    a.	The problem is the argument for the if statement is incorrect and it should be “if (n==0)…”.
